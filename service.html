            <p class="txt">we can make a meal plan for you by telling us your<br>
              • schedule-Before we plan which recipes we’ll be cooking for you , we need to figure out the time of you eat. This will help us determine which style of recipe we will choose for your meal plan.<br>
              • recipes-based on your schedule, you may need a specific style of recipe. Perhaps a slow cooker recipe that you can have simmering away as you do housework on your day off? Maybe you’re looking for something that makes great leftovers so you can cook once ,eat all week?  Do you need a one pot meal to keep cleanup fast and easy? Fear not , for somtss cook has got you covered. you can also help us make a list of recipes that you can use in your meal plan(s) based on these factors.<br>
                     We can also help you make a grocery list , This is probably the step where most people say, “nuh-uh” and go back to spending thousands on take out. BUT this is where the magic happens and where you’ll save the most money. Here’s how it works…<br>
              1.) we will go through each recipe on your plan and write down every ingredient and the quantity needed.<br>
              2.) we will help take the list to your kitchen and cross check it with what’s in your pantry and fridge.<br>
              3.) we will go through item by item and cross off everything you already have on hand.<br>
              4.)Everything that remains on the list after we cross check your pantry is your final grocery list</p>

            <h3 class="cook" style="color:rgb(204, 178, 200);">Event catering</h3>
            <p>RATE IS #1,500,000 above (depends on the amount of people we are cooking for)</p>
            <p class="txt">A good place to start planning for an event is to understand the different types of catering options available to you. The reason being that each type has a different type of planning, pricing, and ordering procedure. Narrowing down to one of these choices will not only save you time and money, but will help you simplify the menu choices and the type of services that you will need. <br>
             1. Wedding Catering - a wedding is one of the most important events in a couple’s lives. Unlike corporate catering, wedding catering is no casual affair. It requires some significant attention to detail and timing as well as clear communication with all members of the wedding crew, including the DJ, bride and groom, vendors and photographers. Wedding catering is much more than cooking and serving food. we can cater as a  full-service wedding caterer i.e we will be  responsible for some décor, table arrangements, and food presentation. we also take into consideration themes and fantasies and accommodate for food allergies and dietary restrictions. More importantly, we coordinate rentals like linen and serve ware as well as staffing. we can also cater for a first-class wedding caterer ,i.e we will take over the logistical planning so that the couple and their guests can enjoy a stress-free day. <br>
2.Social event catering-Social event functions are more intimate affairs and require greater attention to detail by the caterer. The category encompasses special events such as birthday parties, retirement celebrations, grand openings, housewarming parties, and bridal and baby showers. Appetizers, décor, bartenders, and servers are some of what may be included in social event catering packages. Due to their small nature, social event catering menus differ from party to party. That’s because the clients’ dietary needs, allergens, preferences and cultural beliefs have to be considered to make the event successful. <br>We also cater for any type of events.
